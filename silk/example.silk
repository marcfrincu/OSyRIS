# This workflow example computes the sum of the first 10 natural numbers by using the loop construct
# It can be tested by using the DummyServiceExample service

A := [i1:input, o1:output=1, "processing"="return-successor", "instances"="1"];

# Compute the sum and the next number in the list as long as it is smaller than 10
A[a=o1], B[b=o1] -> B[i1=a#i2=b], A[i1=a] | a < 10;
